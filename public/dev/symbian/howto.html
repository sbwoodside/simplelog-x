<p>Last major update, 2005/04/03
</p>

<p>NB: I have not yet switched to Tiger because I'm in the middle of a development cycle.
If you get it to work on Tiger, please let me know about it.
I'll update this document once I upgrade.
</p>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>So you want to program for the millions of symbian cell phones using C++, but you just
can't stand Windows. Or you don't want to shell out the $$$ for codewarrior. Or you feel
more comfortable programming in a standard UNIX environment. Or you prefer using 
normal makefiles to the utterly hideous makmake build system.
Or you just want to stick it to "the man" and try something different. 
Here I've tried to document the procedure I used to setup, install and program for Symbian
on a Windows-free environment. Mac OS X is required.
</p>

<h3>Looking for Linux?</h3>

<p>This used to be a Linux / OS X hybrid howto, but the whole point for me all along was
to be working on OS X.... now it's finally possible to do that, so I've rewritten it
to be OS X focused.
However, the simple fact that you can do this on OS X means that you can do it on Linux
as well, in fact more easily at this point.
Many of the tips in this howto apply equally well to Linux.
If you want to do Symbian dev on Linux, I recommend
you use 
<a href="http://www.koeniglich.de/symbian_sdk_on_unix.html">Rudolph König's sdk2unix</a>
which has become fairly straightforward I think.
(I use it, in modified form, below.)
There's also a complete resource list at the end of this HOWTO.
</p>


<h2>Changes</h2>

<h3>2005/04/02</h3>

<p>Complete revision of the HOWTO to be specifically for building right on OS X.
Which is what I always intended anyway, but it wasn't possible until this year.
</p>

<h3>2004/12/26</h3>

<p>There have been some developments since the last major update that aren't included
in this HOWTO yet.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Rudolf Koenig has moved his sdk2unix files to his 
<a href="http://www.koeniglich.de/">home page</a>. 
The lastest version is newer than the one used in this HOWTO:
<a href="http://www.koeniglich.de/symbian_sdk_6.1_on_linux.html">version 1.4</a>.
For Series 60, it still uses the old GCC (gcc.539.src.zip) and 
the Series 60 SDK 1.2.
</li>
<li>The 
<a href="http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/symbian-gcc/">Symbian GCC Improvement Project</a>
has released a Symbian GCC compiler based on GCC 3.0.
Reports indicate that the compiled code is substantially faster on the device,
faster than what you get from Symbian Corp's own version that is.
Speed and size improvements are in the range of 10%.
It should be possible to substitute in something like gcc-3.0-psion-98r2 in for
the official version when you reach that step in Rudolf's instructions.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Read this</h2>

<p>A few notes before we begin.
</p>

<h3>Nokia-oriented but not Nokia-specific</h3>

<p>This HOWTO will guide you through installing the Nokia Series 60 SDK. It just happens
coincidentally that Series 60 is by far the most popular of all the Symbian flavours.
However.... if you want to program for say UIQ or whatever you can still use most of these
instructions, because the whole toolchain (including sdk2unix) is designed to work with any
of the SDKs.
</p>

<h3>There is no emulator
</h3>

<p>There's no emulator available. I suppose it's no shock that the nokia emulator
for windows doesn't run on Mac OS X. In fact, it doesn't run on
<a href="http://www.winehq.com/">wine</a> either.
Is that really such a bad thing? It depends. The "emulator" is actually NOT an emulator,
it's a simulator. It doesn't actually emulate the ARM instruction set. Instead, they
have effectively ported the entire Symbian / Series 60 API to windows. You build a windows
binary file, which links against the ported libraries. So you can't actually take your
ARM binaries and try them out in the emulator. There are some fairly major differences
between the simulator and the real Symbian /Series 60 devices. One would be speed, but
the most major is in memory management. There are however other more subtle differences.
</p>

<p>It's fairly easy to set up logging to a file on the target device. So as long as you
have had some practice debugging code with the use of extensive printf-style statements,
it's possible to get along quite well (in my opinion) without the simulator or the 
debugger.
</p>


<h3>What's the OS environment?
</h3>

<p>I picked Mac OS X because my main computer is a Powerbook. I have a wireless connection
which allows me to work wherever I wish. The OS X is 10.3.8.
</p>

<h3>Editing the code
</h3>

<p>I do most of my editing
<a href="http://apple.com/xcode">XCode</a>, Apple's free IDE for Mac OS X. This is the
IDE I am most familiar with. I'm sure that something like Eclipse would also be just
fine, but this is what I use. I also do a fair bit of editing with command-line 
emacs.
</p>

<h3>Deploying builds</h3>

<p>Here's another reason to use Mac OS X. OS X comes with very high-quality support
for bluetooth that includes all of the various Series 60 phones. So, deploying is a 
simple matter of drag-and-drop onto the bluetooth icon. You transfer the app to the
phone, it shows up as a message, the installer will launch automatically. Most
symbian binaries are pretty small, so transfer times are minimal.
</p>

<p>Another strategy is to copy the binary up to a web server that's publicly accessible.
Then you can bookmark the location on your phone and download it "over the air" (called OTA).
Again, the installer will kick in and install automatically. This will drive up your
data bill though.
</p>




<p>Now that we have those items out of the way, now we get to the installation.
</p>


<h2>Prep your local system
</h2>

<p>You should install the full suite of Apple's 
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/developertools/">free developer tools</a>.
</p>

<p>You should also install
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/">fink</a> in order to get various command-line
tools that you'll need along the way.
If you get to some step below that requires a command-line tool (e.g. 
bunzip2, recode) that you
don't have, you need to install it from fink.
(Some fink tools may only be available in the unstable tree, see the
<a href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/faq/usage-fink.php">fink documentation</a>
for details on how to access it.)
</p>

<p>
You may also need X11, e.g. 
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/x11/">Apple's free X11</a>.
Without X11 you might have problems with missing libraries when you build gcc
or something else.
</p>



<h2>Install gcc
</h2>

<p>Let's get started.</p>

<p>We're going to use the slightly old version of gcc that Symbian still amazingly
uses. It's called "gcc539". We're going to use
a version that's been modified by 
<a href="http://www.symbian.com/developer/steam.html">Alfred E. Heggestad</a>.
</p>

<code><pre>
wget http://symbianos.org/download/gcc-539-2aeh-source.tar.bz2
bunzip2 gcc-539-2aeh-source.tar.bz2
tar -xvf gcc-539-2aeh-source.tar
</pre></code>

<p>This will create a directory "src" with the gcc code in it.
Now get a patch by 
<a href="http://www.symbianos.org/yabbse/index.php?action=viewprofile;user=andreh">Andre Howe</a>.
(You're going to have to patch code quite a few times in this HOWTO.
Hopefully the package maintainers will integrate these fixes
into their code sooner or later and this won't be necessary any more.)
</p>

<code><pre>
wget http://www.symbianos.org/~andreh/diff539
patch -p0 &lt; diff539
</pre></code>

<p>You now have a patched src directory. Next you have to pick a destination 
directory. This is where gcc will be installed. I recommend
<code>/usr/local/symbian</code> (you'll need root access).
Create the destination dir and then build gcc.
</p>

<code><pre>
sudo mkdir /usr/local/symbian
mkdir obj
cd obj
sh ../src/configure --prefix=/usr/local/symbian \
  --exec-prefix=/usr/local/symbian --target=arm-epoc-pe
make
</pre></code>

<p>Well, despite all the patches, you're still going to get an error from 
src/libiberty/strerror.c. So hand apply the following change 
(basically just comment out lines 465 and 466).
</p>

<code><pre>
--- ../src/libiberty/strerror.c Fri Apr  1 01:00:01 2005
+++ ../src/libiberty/strerror.c.orig    Fri Apr  1 00:59:21 2005
@@ -462,8 +462,8 @@
 
 #else
 
-//extern int sys_nerr;
-//extern char *sys_errlist[];
+extern int sys_nerr;
+extern char *sys_errlist[];
 
 #endif
</pre></code>

<p>...and <code>make</code> again. It's going to take a little while.
Finally, install it (requires sudo for root access).
But first, fix a stupid permissions problem that also needs to be fixed...
</p>

<code><pre>
chmod u+x ../src/dejagnu/mkinstalldirs \
  ../src/tcl/unix/mkLinks ../src/texinfo/mkinstalldirs \
  ../src/tk/unix/mkLinks ../src/expect/mkinstalldirs
sudo make install
</pre></code>

<p>Now symbian gcc is installed.
</p>


<h2>Install makesis, rcomp, bmconv, petran</h2>

<p>These are all essential tools to build symbian apps. The story is, that
Symbian kindly open sourced a number of tools in order to make it easier for people
like us to play. The packaged SDKs however only come with compiled EXEs for windows.
So we just have to get the source and build them ourselves.
</p>

<p>This is pretty straightforward. Get the source, unpack, make, test, install.
</p>

<h3>makesis</h3>

<code><pre>
wget http://symbianos.org/~andreh/makesis-2.0.0.tar.gz
tar -xvzf makesis-2.0.0.tar.gz
cd makesis-2.0.0
make
make regtest
sudo cp src/makesis /usr/local/symbian/bin/
</pre></code>

<h3>rcomp</h3>

<code><pre>
wget http://symbianos.org/~andreh/rcomp-7.0.1.tar.gz
tar -xvzf rcomp-7.0.1.tar.gz
cd rcomp-7.0.1/
make
make regtest
</pre></code>

<p>At this point you might hit a snag, a lot of test failures. 
I applied 
<a href="http://www.sourceress.net/patch-rcomp">this patch</a>, 
<a href="http://www.sourceress.net/patch-rcomp">from here</a>, but it still 
failed all kinds of tests. Oh well. It seems to work anyway.
</p>

<code><pre>
sudo cp src/rcomp /usr/local/symbian/bin/
</pre></code>

<h3>bmconv</h3>
<code><pre>
wget http://symbianos.org/~andreh/bmconv-1.1.0-2.tar.gz
tar -xvzf bmconv-1.1.0-2.tar.gz 
cd bmconv-1.1.0-2/
make
make regtest
sudo cp src/bmconv /usr/local/bin/
</pre></code>

<h3>petran</h3>
<code><pre>
wget http://symbianos.org/~andreh/petran-1.1.0.tar.gz
tar -xvzf petran-1.1.0.tar.gz
cd petran-1.1.0/
make
make regtest
sudo cp petran/petran e32uid/uidcrc /usr/local/symbian/bin/
</pre></code>



<h2>Install sdk2unix
</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.koeniglich.de/symbian_sdk_on_unix.html">sdk2unix</a>
is a tool by Rudolf König. It replaces the idiotic makmake system
that Symbian uses with a sensible and normal makefile system. And, it does a whole
lot of conversion on the SDK to make it work sensibly in a Unixy kind of way.
It's really good stuff.
</p>

<p>Rudi provides his own installation instructions which are fine for Linux but
you can't use them for OS X (at the moment, anyway) so ignore them. Everything
will be explained here.
Note that sdk2unix supports other SDKs too, like UIQ, etc, not just Series 60.
</p>

<p>Anyway, download and unpack it.
</p>

<code><pre>
wget http://www.koeniglich.de/packages/sdk2unix-1.5.tar.gz
tar -xvzf sdk2unix-1.5.tar.gz
</pre></code>

<p>Now copy some of its useful stuff to where we installed the compiler.
</p>

<code><pre>
cd sdk2unix-1.5
sudo cp -rp data/gcc539/makerules /usr/local/symbian/lib
sudo cp data/gcc539/specs \
  /usr/local/symbian/lib/gcc-lib/arm-epoc-pe/2.9-psion-98r2/specs
sudo cp bin/xmakesis.pl /usr/local/symbian/bin
</pre></code>

<p>Create some links...
</p>

<code><pre>
cd /usr/local/symbian/bin/
sudo ln -s \
  ../lib/gcc-lib/arm-epoc-pe/2.9-psion-98r2/cpp arm-epoc-pe-cpp
sudo ln -s arm-epoc-pe-as as
</pre></code>

<h3>genaif</h3>

<p>genaif (a special sdk2unix tool) requires a patch to make it work on OS X.
You need to get the genaif patch from ... 
<a href="http://symbianos.org/pipermail/gnupoc/2005-February/000018.html">
mailing list archives</a> (we're on the bleeding edge here people) ... and copy and paste
it into a file called "patch.txt".
When you build genaif, ignore the warnings about PutLong etc.
</p>

<code><pre>
cd genaif/
patch -p0 &lt; patch.txt
cc -o genaif genaif.c
sudo mv genaif /usr/local/symbian/bin/
</pre></code>


<h2>Install the Software Developer's Kit
</h2>

<p>The SDK contains the essential tools and libraries to develop
for whatever phone you target. 
All of the important Symbian SDKs can be found at
<a href="http://www.symbian.com/developer/sdks.asp">Symbian's site</a>.
</p>

<p>Download
<a href="http://www.symbian.com/developer/sdks_s60v21.asp">
Series 60 SDK 2.1 for Symbian OS, Nokia Edition</a>
(you have to use the web interface...).
It should come out as S60_SDK_2_1_NET.zip, 115.9 MB.
Don't unzip it.
</p>

<p>Decide where you want to store the final SDK. I personally use
~/sandbox/symbian/SDK_21 ... this could be useful later on if you want to have multiple
SDKs installed.
</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I'll assume that you've downloaded the zip file to ~/Desktop. Don't
unzip it. That will be done for you automatically by code that I wrote that Rudi
put into sdk2unix.
Now invoke sdk2unix's magic install command, with the location of the SDK archive, 
where you want it to go, and the location of the symbian gcc you installed before.
</p>

<code><pre>
cd sdk2unix-1.5
bin/install_series60_sdk_21 \
  ~/Desktop/S60_SDK_2_1_NET.zip \
  ~/sandbox/symbian/S60_21 \
  /usr/local/symbian/bin/arm-epoc-pe-gcc
</pre></code>

<p>And that's it. You're done installing the SDK. 
Let's build something.
</p>


<h2>Build a S60 example</h2>

<p>sdk2unix installs makefiles into several of the series60ex directories. You can
find them using the Finder or the find command.
</p>

<code><pre>
cd S60_21/
find . -name makefile
</pre></code>

<p>I assume you are familiar with makefiles. 
If not you might as well start with the 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">GNU Make</a> page.
</p>

<h3>Fix core makefiles</h3>

<p>There's a set of core makefiles that we copied into /usr/local/symbian/lib/makerules.
You'll need to hand-apply the following patch to epoc.general to make it work,
since we deviated a little bit from the default sdk2unix install.
Obviously SDKLOC should be where you put the SDK on your system.
</p>

<code><pre>

</pre></code>

<p>(Note: this is actually a little bit messed up if you want to actually 
separate the SDK and the gcc installation properly. But I haven't quite figured out
how to do that yet.)
</p>

<h3>Recode the example files</h3>

<p>For some reason sdk2unix didn't recode the examples. You need to recode
them from DOS to UNIX formats. Mainly this affects the line endings. If you don't do this,
you're going to get loads of errors from rcomp.
</p>

<code><pre>
cd S60_21/series60ex/
find . -type f -print | xargs recode -f dos..latin1
</pre></code>

<h3>Fix example makefile</h3>

<p>Now we're going to build an example, specifically the series 60 form example.
It's in <code>series60ex/form</code>.
In the src directory,
there's a makefile, installed by sdk2unix, but it needs to be fixed a bit.
(These are flaws from sdk2unix.)
</p>

<p>NB - You must also change the first line to reflect your own path to the symbian
libraries e.g. /usr/local/symbian.

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>When you've applied those changes, now make sure you are in the src directory, and 
type make.
</p>

<code><pre>
cd src
make
</pre></code>

<h3>Include files and case sensitivity</h3>

<p>You might get some errors about missing include files.</p>

<p>Many of the source files in the examples have #include statements that use
the wrong case for include files. They will include upper case letters but sdk2unix
converted everything to lower case. The DOS/Windows filessystem is case insensitive but
every UNIX including Linux and OS X is case sensitive.
</p>

<p>Edit the source files and lowercase the names of the includes.
When you're done and everything works you should get this result from make.

app and copy aknexform.sis to the phone. Install and run it. It will show off a bunch
of different kinds of forms that S60 supports.
</p>


<h3>Adapting the makefile to your own app</h3>

<p>You can basically copy the form makefile to your own app. It should be fairly
self-explanatory how to change it. One gotcha is that there's a rule in it:
</p>

<code><pre>
aknexformapp.o: $(NAME).rsc
</pre></code>

<p>You have to change that to:
</p>

<code><pre>
yourownapp.o: $(NAME).rsc
</pre></code>



<h2>General tips</h2>

<h3>On-target logging</h3>

<p>There is no on-target debugger so you'll have to use some file of file logging
to find out what your program is doing. Get yourself a copy of the free and excellent
<a href="http://users.skynet.be/domi/fexplorer.htm">FExplorer</a>
file utility for symbian.
</p>

<p>To log to a file, you can use the RFileLogger API. Something like this:
<pre>  RFileLogger::Write(LOG_DIR, LOG_NAME, LOG_MODE, msg);</pre>
</p>

<h3>Display extended error codes on the phone</h3>

<p>You'll definitely need to read this article as well:

<h3>SymbianOS.org</h3>

<p>
<a href="http://symbianos.org/">Open Source programs for SymbianOS</a>
has code, mailing lists, online forums, a wiki, etc. for open source development
for and on Symbian.
</p>

<h3>Symbian GCC Improvement Project</h3>

<p>You might also want to experiment with gcc's from the 
<a href="http://www.inf.u-szeged.hu/symbian-gcc/">Symbian GCC Improvement Project</a>
which are newer but I can't guarantee they'll work.
</p>

<h3>gnupoc</h3>

<p>There is more of a straight port of Symbian tools for Linux called 
<a href="http://gnupoc.sourceforge.net/">GnuPoc</a>. 
(It's a play on the hideous name EPOC which was what Symbian was called back in the 90s.)
The gnupoc project
has generated some great ports of various symbian tools to Linux and OS X.
However, as a complete system, I tried out gnupoc
and found it unsatisfying. 
Just like on windows, it uses makmake and that's just a mess. However, they claim
to have an emulator for some of the UIQ phones so if you're developing
for those phones you might want to check it out.
